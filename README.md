"Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. It is widely applied in areas like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research. Machine learning models, including logistic regression, deep learning, and transformer-based models, help automate this process. Techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings convert text into numerical features for better sentiment classification. However, handling imbalanced datasets is crucial, and methods like SMOTE can improve accuracy. Sentiment analysis also faces challenges, including sarcasm detection and understanding context. Despite challenges, it continues to enhance decision-making in businesses and AI applications."
